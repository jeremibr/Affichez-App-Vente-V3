/**
 * Start loading a screen while the pointer is still on its way to the link.
 *
 * A click is preceded by roughly 200-400 ms of hovering, which is dead time the
 * browser can spend on the two things that make the next screen wait:
 *
 *   1. **the route's JavaScript chunk** - since routes became lazy in App.tsx,
 *      visiting a screen for the first time costs a network fetch before React
 *      can render anything at all;
 *   2. **the first query it will run** - the filter options and week lists,
 *      which are the same for everybody and the slowest queries in the app.
 *
 * Both land in a cache that the page then hits instead of the network:
 * `import()` results are memoised by the module system, and the RPCs go through
 * rpcCache, whose in-flight de-duplication means the page's own call joins the
 * request already in progress rather than starting a second one.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort. It fires on hover and focus, never on render,
 * so it costs nothing on a screen nobody is heading to, and a failure is
 * swallowed - this is work the user did not ask for and must never surface as
 * an error.
