/**
 * A short-lived cache in front of `supabase.rpc`, so navigating back to a page
 * you were just on does not refetch everything from zero.
 *
 * Three things, and only three:
 *
 * 1. **A TTL.** Inside it, a repeat call resolves from memory with no network
 *    at all — the page paints on the next frame. This is what makes moving
 *    between screens instant.
 * 2. **In-flight de-duplication.** Two callers asking for the same thing before
 *    the first reply lands share one request. That is what makes `prefetch()`
 *    worth anything: hovering a nav link starts the query, and the page's own
 *    call a moment later joins it instead of starting a second one.
 * 3. **Explicit invalidation**, for the Realtime subscriptions and the
 *    "Actualiser" buttons.
 *
 * **Stale data is never served.** A common trick here is stale-while-
 * revalidate: paint the old numbers immediately, fetch in the background, swap
 * them when it lands. It is faster still, and it is the wrong trade for this
 * app — these are sales figures people quote in meetings, and a revenue total
 * that silently changes a second after you read it is worse than one that took
 * a second to arrive. Past the TTL we wait for the real answer.
 *
 * The TTLs are set against how often the data underneath can actually change,
 * which is the Zoho sync cadence — five minutes for invoices, twelve hours for
 * accounts and leads. Sixty seconds is comfortably inside all of them.
