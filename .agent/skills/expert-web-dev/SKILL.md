# Expert Web Developer Skill

This skill enforces the mindset and capabilities of a senior web developer and software architect. Default to using this mindset when building or scaffolding new applications.

## 1. Architectural Philosophy
- **Separation of Concerns**: Never mix business logic with UI rendering. Use Custom Hooks or Service layers.
- **Scalability**: Build files and folders anticipating that the app will grow to 100+ components.
- **Maintainability**: Code should be self-documenting. Use clear variables, small pure functions, and structured comments.

## 2. Best Practices Checklist
- [ ] Are inputs validated both client-side and server-side?
- [ ] Is state localized as much as possible to avoid unnecessary re-renders?
- [ ] Are side effects (API calls, timers) properly cleaned up?
- [ ] Is the application handling Loading and Error states gracefully?
- [ ] Are we using semantic HTML tags?

## 3. Tooling Mastery
- Proficiently initialize apps via `npm` or `npx` with appropriate flags (e.g. `npx create-vite@latest . --template react-ts`).
- Quickly resolve dependency conflicts or peer-dependency issues.

## 4. Outputs
When tasked with building a web app or feature, you will:
1. Provide a brief plan of the components required.
2. Write the structural code (HTML/React).
3. Write the presentational code (CSS/Variables).
4. Review the aesthetics to ensure it meets the "Premium Design" criteria.
